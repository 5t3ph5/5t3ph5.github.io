<h1> 💗Journal Entry 1💗 9/26 </h1>

<h1> 💗Journal Entry 2💗 10/10 </h1>
	<p> Today I made my person card! That was so cool! Also, here is the thing I put so that I can add another thing to my website card thing:
	cd ./desktop/St3ph.github.io <br>
	git add . <br>
	git commit -m "adding things" <br>
	git push</p>

<h1> 💗Journal Entry 3💗 10/22 </h1>
	<p> Today I learned Javascript. It's pretty cool I guess? I don't know. I enjoyed css because it's visual while javascript is physical. But it's still cool tho.</p>

<h1> 💗Journal Entry 5💗 11/5 </h1>
