<h1> ðŸ’—Journal Entry 1ðŸ’— 9/26 </h1>
	<p> Today I learned how to do different fonts. I am also reformatting my website, and getting ready to publish it. I also finally finished my first project! When you hover over the square, it changes color and spins into a circle. It's so cool! </p>

<h1> ðŸ’—Journal Entry 2ðŸ’— 10/10 </h1>
	<p> Today I made my person card! I also made my second project "transitions." It's a little stupid, but it's two pictures that fade into each other when you hover over them. Also, here is the thing I put so that I can add another thing to my website card thing:
	cd ./desktop/St3ph.github.io <br>
	git add . <br>
	git commit -m "adding things" <br>
	git push</p>

<h1> ðŸ’—Journal Entry 3ðŸ’— 10/22 </h1>
	<p> Today I learned Javascript. It's pretty cool I guess? I don't know. I enjoyed css because it's visual while javascript is physical. But it's still cool though. With javascript I made my project entitled "javascript", which is basically just a thing that says "this is my first javascript project" and says something in the console log.</p>

<h1> ðŸ’—Journal Entry 4ðŸ’— 10/29 </h1>
	<p> Today I finished up my jumpscare. I'm really proud of it. Spoiler alert, but you keep clicking with your mouse even when it says don't until something shows up that jumpscares you.</p>

<h1> ðŸ’—Journal Entry 5ðŸ’— 11/5 </h1>
	<p> I  worked on my website a ton and redid my Index. And now I'm proud of it but I also want to finish up my homepage and make that the index. So yeah I'll see how that goes! Also, I did my project "hedgehog clock." It basically just goes in a row counting up from 1-infinity. It's not super cool, but I was learning new techniques. </p>

<h1> ðŸ’—Journal Entry 6ðŸ’— 11/14 </h1>
	<p> I finished my index page just now. I'm happy with the way it turned out. I also did another project for Thanksgiving. It is basically a turkey that spins around when you hover on it. It's simple, but cool nonetheless.</p>

<h1> ðŸ’—Journal Entry 7ðŸ’— 11/26 </h1>
	<p> So, 2 things. Firsit of all, I made a new project that has photos of Emilia going to random places across the screen. This was me using a concept called "Math.random". The other thing is that I am going to pose a question that I am going to answer: What is a function? </p>
		<br><br>
		A function is an action; you can put things inside of it. When you "call it" or "run it" it does the things. 

		<br><br>
		You can define and specify what your function does so that it does specific things (like changing specific traits or characteristics of an element on the page)
		<br><br>
		Sometimes when we want to run a function on the whole document we say "document.___"
		<br><br>
		Some functions include addEventListener(), setInterval(), createElement(), console.log(), alert(), play(), pause(), appendChild(), and .classlist.add(). 

<h1> ðŸ’—Journal Entry 8ðŸ’— 12/3 </h1>
	<p> I finished a project where I changed the color and the position of a div randomly. Pretty cool! </p>

<h1> ðŸ’—Journal Entry 9ðŸ’— 12/10 </h1>
	<p> I did a really fun project where I made a little instrution manual and also made this button you can press to change colors. I don't know, it was fun. </p>

<h1> ðŸ’—Journal Entry 10ðŸ’— 12/12 </h1>
	<p> I made a project today entitled "Holiday song". I think it still works, but it's very buggy. Basically you click on the picture and Mariah Carey's song "all I want for christmas is you" plays. It's kind of cool? I don't know. </p>

<h1> ðŸ’—Journal Entry 11ðŸ’— 1/14 </h1>
	<p> Today I made a slot machine. I am going to make a lab to fix the alert function and make it a text function or something, but for now this is what it will be. </p>

<h1> ðŸ’—Journal Entry 12ðŸ’— 1/16 </h1>
	<p> Today I finished my slot machine. I'm so proud of it because it turned out really well. So how does it work? You click on the handle on the side and the fruits randomly appear in the three slots. If you get 2/3, a message will appear and you will get 10 points. If you get all three, a separate message will appear and you will get 20 points.</p>

<h1> ðŸ’—Journal Entry 13ðŸ’— 1/30 </h1>
	<p> Today I finished my confetti valentines day project. It's for Emilia because she made one for me. Basically it's confetti that falls down and there's a poem that we "wrote".</p>

<h1> ðŸ’—Journal Entry 14ðŸ’— 2/6 </h1>
	<p> Today I worked on my valentine's day project. I'm proud of the progress I've made so far! I'm not even close to being done with my project, but I'm getting closer now. Basically it's going to be a page that says "Happy Valentine's Day" with a heart beating under it. The heart will say "click me" on it, and when you click on it it goes to a poem for my friend.</p>

<h1> ðŸ’—Journal Entry 14ðŸ’— 2/11 </h1>
	<p> Today I FINALLY finished my valentine's day project for Emilia. I'm so proud of it. I wish that I had been able to actually code the pictures to go on there, but I couldn't figure it out so alas. Ah well. But yeah! </p>

<h1> ðŸ’—Journal Entry 15ðŸ’— 2/25 </h1>
	<p> I finally just fixed my holiday song project! It hasn't been working lately and I've been trying to fix it but now it finally works! </p>

<h1> ðŸ’—Journal Entry 16ðŸ’— 3/6 </h1>
	<p> We went over how to make many divs using the same function. It makes sense now, and I'm happy that we went over this. Other than that, I think we're just reviewing stuff to prep for when we ultimately start our final project. </p>
