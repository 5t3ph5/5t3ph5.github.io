	<p> Today I learned Javascript. It's pretty cool I guess? I don't know. I enjoyed css because it's visual while javascript is physical. But it's still cool tho.</p>

	<p?> What is a function?
		<br><br>
		A function is an action; you can put things inside of it. When you "call it" or "run it" it does the things. 

		<br><br>
		You can define and specify what your function does so that it does specific things (like changing specific traits or characteristics of an element on the page)
		<br><br>
		Sometimes when we want to run a function on the whole document we say "document.___"
		<br><br>
		Some functions include addEventListener(), setInterval(), createElement(), console.log(), alert(), play(), pause(), appendChild(), and .classlist.add().
