<h1> ðŸ’—Journal Entry 1ðŸ’— 9/26 </h1>
	<p> Today I learned how to do different fonts. I am also reformatting my website, and getting ready to publish it. But quite honestly I'm pretty tired today and don't really want to be here right now. I already took my photo and Comp Sci is fun but why can't it just be the weekend already??? </p>

	<p> Today I made my person card! That was so cool! Also, here is the thing I put so that I can add another thing to my website card thing:
	cd ./desktop/St3ph.github.io <br>
	git add . <br>
	git commit -m "adding things" <br>
	git push</p>

	<p> Today I gilearned Javascript. It's pretty cool I guess? I don't know. I enjoyed css because it's visual while javascript is physical. But it's still cool tho.</p>
