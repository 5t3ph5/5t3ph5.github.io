<h1> ðŸ’—Journal Entry 1ðŸ’— </h1>
	<p> Today I learned how to do different fonts. I am also reformatting my website, and getting ready to publish it. But quite honestly I'm pretty tired today and don't really want to be here right now. I already took my photo and Comp Sci is fun but why can't it just be the weekend already??? </p>
